# ECON407 -- Fall 2020

## Topics in Macroeconomics
The class will be a mixture of theory and programming. The first half or 2/3 of this course is about learning the computational tools used in modern macroeconomics, and applying the programming tools. Then, based on the

- **Instructor:** Peifan Wu, peifan.wu@ubc.ca
- **Office Hours:** Tuesdays 9:00am-10:00am, Vancouver Time
- **Prerequisites:** One of ECON 301, ECON 304 and one of ECON 302, ECON 305 and one of ECON 303, ECON 306. Not very strict though.
  - A little programming experience is very valuable, but you will be able to fill in the blanks with some hard work.
  - We'll go through some introductory contents in the class
- **Textbook:** No Textbook. We will follow a small subset of QuantEcon Python lectures https://python.quantecon.org/index_toc.html
- **Learning Environment:** Regular (virtual) attendance is expected.

## Course Materials and Communications
- Course Materials will be online
- Course stream through Canvas
- Slides, Notes, Communications, Announcements, and Grades: all through Canvas

## Grading
This will be based on projects and problems sets, *with no exams*.
- 5-6 Problem Sets throughout the semester (computational, or math): 65%
- Final Project: 35%, I haven't made the final decision yet, but will be one of the following two,
  - Option 1: a computation project. You'll have a great deal of freedom to implement a small final project using what we learn.
  - Option 2: review of a paper (more like "referee report"). You can choose a paper from a list I provide, and show your own understanding of the paper and your comments.
  - I'll decide that soon as the semester goes.

## Programming Language Choice
While I will show programs in Python and we will use several QuantEcon Python lectures, you don't have to stick to Python, as you can use Julia, Matlab, or other languages. Stata doesn't count -- it won't be sufficient for our class.

**Write me an email** if you are not going to use Python/Julia/Matlab.

(subject to change: we might not able to cover everything)


## UBC Statement on Academic Freedom
During this pandemic, the shift to online learning has greatly altered teaching and studying at UBC,
including changes to health and safety considerations. Keep in mind that some UBC courses might cover
topics that are censored or considered illegal by non-Canadian governments. This may include, but is not
limited to, human rights, representative government, defamation, obscenity, gender or sexuality, and
historical or current geopolitical controversies. If you are a student living abroad, you will be subject to the
laws of your local jurisdiction, and your local authorities might limit your access to course material or take
punitive action against you. UBC is strongly committed to academic freedom, but has no control over
foreign authorities (please visit http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,33,86,0 for an
articulation of the values of the University conveyed in the Senate Statement on Academic Freedom).
Thus, we recognize that students will have legitimate reason to exercise caution in studying certain
subjects. If you have concerns regarding your personal situation, consider postponing taking a course
with manifest risks, until you are back on campus or reach out to your academic advisor to find substitute
courses. For further information and support, please visit: http://academic.ubc.ca/supportresources/freedom-expression

## UBC Academic Integrity
The academic enterprise is founded on honesty, civility, and integrity. As members of this
enterprise, all students are expected to know, understand, and follow the codes of conduct
regarding academic integrity. At the most basic level, this means submitting only original
work done by you and acknowledging all sources of information or ideas and attributing
them to others as required. This also means you should not cheat, copy, or mislead others
about what is your work. Violations of academic integrity (i.e., misconduct) lead to the
breakdown of the academic enterprise, and therefore serious consequences arise and harsh
sanctions are imposed. For example, incidences of plagiarism or cheating may result in a
mark of zero on the assignment or exam and more serious consequences may apply if the
matter is referred to the President’s Advisory Committee on Student Discipline. Careful
records are kept in order to monitor and prevent recurrences.
